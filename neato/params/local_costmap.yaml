  # Hydro and later releases use plugins for all costmap_2d layers. If you don't provide a plugins parameter then the initialization code will assume that your configuration is pre-Hydro and will load a default set of plugins with default namespaces. Your parameters will be moved to the new namespaces automagically. The default namespaces are static_layer, obstacle_layer and inflation_layer.
  _: this here to maintain format
  static_map: false #local is generated so this should be false.

  ### Plugins
  #plugins: pre-Hydro behavior # Default: pre-Hydro behavior Sequence of plugin specifications, one per layer. Each specification is a dictionary with name and type fields. The name is used to define the parameter namespace for the plugin. See the tutorials for examples.

  ### Coordinate frame and tf parameters
  global_frame: 'map' # Default: "/map" The global frame for the costmap to operate in.
  # https://answers.ros.org/question/304537/could-not-transform-the-global-plan-to-the-frame-of-the-controller/
  #robot_base_frame: "base_link" # Default: "base_link" The name of the frame for the base link of the robot.
  transform_tolerance: 1.5 # Default: 0.2 Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.

  ### Rate parameters
  #https://answers.ros.org/question/369769/update_frequency-vs-publish_frequency-costmap-parameters/
  #update_frequency: 5.0 # Default: 5.0 The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
  #publish_frequency: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.

  ### Map management parameters
  rolling_window: true # Default: false Whether or not to use a rolling window version of the costmap. If the static_map parameter is set to true, this parameter must be set to false.
  #always_send_full_costmap: false # Default: false If true the full costmap is published to "~costmap" every update. If false only the part of the costmap that has changed is published on the "~costmap_updates" topic.

  # The following parameters can be overwritten by some layers, namely the static map layer.
  #width: 10 # Default: 10 The width of the map in meters.
  #height: 10 # Default: 10 The height of the map in meters.
  resolution: 0.02 # Default: 0.05 The resolution of the map in meters/cell.
  #origin_x: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 The x origin of the map in the global frame in meters.
  #origin_y: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 The y origin of the map in the global frame in meters.
