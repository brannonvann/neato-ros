### General AMCL parameters ###
# particles are the number of "arrows" when determining the location of the robot.
#min_particles: 500 # Default: 100 Minimum allowed number of particles.
#max_particles: 1000 # Default: 5000 Maximum allowed number of particles.
#kld_err: 0.01 # Default: .01 Maximum error between the true distribution and the estimated distribution.
#kld_z: 0.99 # Default: .99 Upper standard normal quantile for (1 - p), where p is the probability that the error on the estimated distrubition will be less than kld_err.
#update_min_d: 0.1 # Default: 0.2 (m) Translational movement required before performing a filter update.
#update_min_a: 0.1 # Default: (pi/6.0 radians) Rotational movement required before performing a filter update.
#resample_interval: 2 # Default: 2 Number of filter updates required before resampling.
#transform_tolerance: 0.5 # Default: .01 seconds Time with which to post-date the transform that is published, to indicate that this transform is valid into the future.
#recovery_alpha_slow: 0.001 # Default: 0.0 (disabled) Exponential decay rate for the slow average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.001.
#recovery_alpha_fast: 0.1 # Default: 0.0 (disabled) Exponential decay rate for the fast average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.1.
#initial_pose_x: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 (m) Initial pose mean (x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#initial_pose_y: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 (m) Initial pose mean (y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#initial_pose_a: 0.0 # Default: 0.0 radians) Initial pose mean (yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#initial_cov_xx: 0.5*0.5 # Default: 0.5*0.5 (m) Initial pose covariance (x*x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#initial_cov_yy: 0.5*0.5 # Default: 0.5*0.5 (m) Initial pose covariance (y*y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#initial_cov_aa: (π/12)*(π/12) # Default: (π/12)*(π/12) radian) Initial pose covariance (yaw*yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution.
#gui_publish_rate: 10.0 # Default: -1.0 (Hz) (disabled) Maximum rate (Hz) at which scans and paths are published for visualization, -1.0 to disable.
#save_pose_rate: 0.5 # Default: 0.5 (Hz) Maximum rate (Hz) at which to store the last estimated pose and covariance to the parameter server, in the variables ~initial_pose_* and ~initial_cov_*. This saved pose will be used on subsequent runs to initialize the filter. -1.0 to disable.
#use_map_topic: false # Default: false When set to true, AMCL will subscribe to the map topic rather than making a service call to receive its map. New in navigation 1.4.2
#first_map_only: false # Default: false When set to true, AMCL will only use the first map it subscribes to, rather than updating each time a new one is received. New in navigation 1.4.2
#selective_resampling: false #Default: false When set to true, will reduce the resampling rate when not needed and help avoid particle deprivation. The resampling will only happen if the effective number of particles (N_eff = 1/(sum(k_i^2))) is lower than half the current number of particles.
